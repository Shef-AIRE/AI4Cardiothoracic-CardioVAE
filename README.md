# Multimodal Variational Autoencoder for Low-cost Cardiac Hemodynamics Instability Detection | [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-022-00605-1)

## Introduction
This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of the **CardioVAE<sub>X, G</sub>** framework, as described in our *Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society (MICCAI'24)* paper "[Multimodal Variational Autoencoder for Low-cost Cardiac Hemodynamics Instability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13658)". **CardioVAE<sub>X, G</sub>** is a multimodal variational autoencoder with a tri-stream pre-training strategy to learn both shared and modality-specific features, thus enabling fine-tuning with both unimodal and multimodal datasets. We pre-trained our **CardioVAE<sub>X, G</sub>** with large unlabeled low-cost chest X-ray (CXR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) modalities from [MIMIC-IV-ECG](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-ecg/1.0/) and [MIMIC-CXR](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/) and then finetuned it on non-invasive detection of cardiac hemodynamic instability (CHDI) with our in-house dataset from [ASPIRE](https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/application-summaries/research-summaries/aspire-registry/). Comprehensive evaluations against existing methods show that **CardioVAE<sub>X, G</sub>** offers promising performance (AUROC = 0.79 and Accuracy = 0.77), representing a significant step forward in the non-invasive prediction of CHDI.
